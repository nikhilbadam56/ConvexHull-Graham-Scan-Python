# ConvexHull-Graham-Scan-Python
In geometry, the convex hull or convex envelope or convex closure of a shape is the smallest convex set that contains it
"Graham Scan", is an algorithm that gives outpupt as a set of points that constitute a convex hull that covers the given cloud of points.
time complexity ```O(nlog n)```(almost linear in number of points)

This video shows the output of the code :

Applications include :
 One of the famous application include, finding the the region to be quanrantined based on the past movement of the infected patient.
